# Great Encryptor

The last encryptor has some limitations, it shifts text correctly, but it shifts all punctuation 
and whitespace too! Let's fix this!

## Example 

### Input
Message: Hello, World!
Shift 3

### Output
Khoor, Zruog!

### Explanation
Note that the letters shift as before but non letters stay the same
